# GHS-distributed
Implementing GHS distributed algorithm


Here's how I am going to start:

1. Writing Prim's algorithm
2. Writing structure and psuedocode for all files, classes, methods and all that is required 
// as per in the slides
3. Then I think about making is distributed
4. Write the code piece by piece and keep on testing
